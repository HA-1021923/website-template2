I am a Statistics PhD candidate at University of California, Irvine. My thesis projects are related to forensic statistics, dimensionality reduction techniques for DNA methylation data, More broadly, I am interested in statistical learning/ machine learning methods, Bayesian non-parametrics, and computational methods. I work with Prof. Hal Stern and Dr. Naomi Kaplan-Damary for my thesis projects. Additionally, I have research collaborations with [CSAFE](https://forensicstats.org/) and [Conte Center at UC Irvine](https://contecenter.uci.edu/).
